<!-- PROJECT LOGO -->
Hi! My name is Ray Zeng, and I’m currently pursuing a master’s degree in information systems management at Carnegie Mellon University, with an expected graduation in December 2024. Before this, I earned a bachelor’s degree in computer science with a focus on Data Science from the University of Queensland. 

I have strong skills in data modeling, data analysis, and dashboard design. In previous internships at companies like LVMH and MSA, I gained extensive experience, particularly in data mining, business intelligence, and the application of cloud services like AWS. I excel at aligning technical solutions with business needs to drive efficiency and cost optimization.

# What I hope to learn
In this course, I hope to learn effective data visualization techniques for different types of data, which will help me build a solid foundation for my career. I am particularly interested in how different visualization methods can communicate insights clearly to various audiences, making complex data more accessible. Once I graduate, I plan to pursue a role in data science or business intelligence, where I can utilize these skills to support decision-making processes with impactful visual analytics.
