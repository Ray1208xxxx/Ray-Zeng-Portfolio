# Project Name: Explore popular tourist lodging locations in different areas of Boston using Airbnb Listings Data

## Summary of the project
My project will use data from Inside Airbnb to explore the distribution of Airbnb listings in Boston and their price trends. The visual analysis of Airbnb listings will reveal which areas of Boston are most preferred by travelers and which factors affect the price of listings, such as the type of listing, location, amenities, and reviews.

In this project I plan to use Python for data processing and data analysis, I want to make a project with machine learning code and visualization for job interviews, I will use Python to analyze different types of listings such as clustering using the KMeans algorithm to find similar types of listings and potential market segments. In addition, I plan to use Partial Dependence plots to show the marginal effect of features on the model's predicted results, helping to provide insight into the impact of individual features on the performance of listings.

The goal of this project is to provide users with a better understanding of the Airbnb market within the city of Boston, thus providing useful insights for hosts, travelers, and decision makers.

> [!NOTE]
> **How to use data:**
- **Distribution of listings:** Using geographic location data, a panoramic map is drawn to show areas where listings are concentrated and sparse.
- **Price analysis:** Use price data combined with geographic information to generate a price heat map to show price differences and areas of high and low prices.
- **Influencing factor analysis:** Explore the main factors influencing the price of a listing by combining information such as the listing's facilities and reviews.
- **Relationship between reviews and booking rate:** Using review data, analyze how hosts' reviews affect the popularity of listings.

# Tools and Applications

| Tool                     | Purpose                                                                                    |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Python**               | Data cleaning, Feature engineering, Preliminary data exploration, Cluster analysis         |
| **Tableau**              | Data visualization                                                                         |
| **Shorthand (maybe use)**| Data storytelling and combining charts and text to create a more engaging experience       |

The final data will be processed and imported into Tableau for visualization, presenting the distribution of listings, price differences, the influence of hosts, popular areas, etc., to tell a story about the Airbnb marketplace. Through these visualizations, my project is able to reveal the geographic concentration of Airbnb listings in Boston, analyze the main factors affecting prices, and explore the relationship between reviews and booking rates.
