# This is for 
Assignment: Assignment 3 & 4: Critique by Design with Tableau (MakeoverMonday)

# Step one: choose a data visualization from MakeoverMonday
Name: The cheapest countries to study in Europe in 2024

![Cheapest Countries to Study in Europe](https://github.com/Ray1208xxxx/Ray-Zeng-Portfolio/blob/main/cheapest-countries-to-study-in-Europe.png)

> I chose to include this visualization because it was in the first few MakeoverMonday's and I didn't find data on education spending in the US (just kidding). I lived in Australia before coming to the U.S., so I was curious about how much it would cost to live and study in another country. This map of study costs in Europe uses a straightforward, simple approach to show how cost data can be expressed and help users understand the economic impact of different study options. Visualizations like this are an inspiration and example for people like me who have a keen interest in education, data-driven decision-making, and how to make data more accessible.

# Step three: sketch out a solution

> Firstly for those unfamiliar with the map of Europe they are less able to quickly identify which countries have higher or lower costs to study abroad as the labels only appear when the mouse is hovered over the area, so I added labels for each country and set them to highlight in a contrasting orange color.
>
> Secondly, although the color gradient is able to show how high or low the relative cost is, it does not provide a direct numerical label. This may interfere with accurate comparisons between different countries, and it is difficult for me to compare the high and low costs of different countries by subtle differences in color and lows it doesn't provide a direct numerical label. This could interfere with accurate comparisons between countries, so I added numbers to allow viewers to visually compare number sizes rather than color shades for similarly colored areas.
