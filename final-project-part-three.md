# The final data story
[Link to Shorthand](https://carnegiemellon.shorthandstories.com/exploring-airbnb-market-dynamics-in-Boston/index.html)

# Changes made since Part II
The audience for my story has two categories: travelers who use Airbnb for their trips, and hosts who rent out Airbnb. They may not have a deep background in data science, so my focus is to use clear, concise charts and storytelling to help them understand the story behind the data and make judgments

In the second part, I originally planned to use Partial Dependency Plot (PDP) to analyze the host data. But when going through the discussion on lec, I realized that they were confused about PDP because it's too technical and hard to understand for users who are not familiar with data science techniques. So I re-framed my host data analysis part and decided to use Annual Revenue to analyze landlord revenues, which would make it more understandable for my audience to understand what I was trying to convey.

Secondly, I made changes to the box plot, I hadn't processed my data before so my graph looked very complex with a lot of data. During the lec discussion they said that the plot was too complicated with data and suggested to reduce the data. So I resample the data using python and then re-updated the data, the new graph looks more concise and makes it simple to understand.
