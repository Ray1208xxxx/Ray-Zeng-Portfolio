# Wireframes / storyboards
> Using your sketches developed last week, further develop your story outline and relevant components visually through the use of wireframing / storyboards. Using your outline as a guide, include high-fidelity, individual draft data visualizations of the critical elements of your story you want to share with your reader. Note: you can build these elements out directly in Shorthand this week if you wish.  Reminder: this template is intended to help, but it doesn't substitute for reading through the full homework assignment!  The assignment page on Canvas includes many important details for completing Part II of the final project.

# User research 

## Target audience
I want to explore Airbnb pricing through my project, so my primary audience target is users who use Airbnb like me, and secondly my project will potentially help Airbnb hosts as well as city administrators, so they are also my target audience. All three of my target groups have different needs regarding the dynamics and trends of the Airbnb market, for example, users or renters want to find quality and cost-effective accommodation, hosts want to understand how to develop better pricing strategies for their properties and optimize their room amenities to cater to the market, and city managers want to understand the spatial distribution of properties and their impact on the city.

Since renters and hosts are easier to find but **city managers are more difficult to interview, I've tried emailing a few but haven't heard back yet, so for now there are only two renters and one host. More specifically, both renters are students who have used Airbnb before and are relatively sensitive to price as well as location, while the host owns an Airbnb listing in boston.
