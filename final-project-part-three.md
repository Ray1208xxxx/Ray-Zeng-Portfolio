# The final data story

# Changes made since Part II
In the second part, I originally planned to use Partial Dependency Plot (PDP) to analyze the host data. But when going through the discussion on lec, I realized that they were confused about PDP because it's too technical and hard to understand for users who are not familiar with data science techniques. So I re-framed my host data analysis part and decided to use Annual Revenue to analyze landlord revenues, which would make it more understandable for my audience to understand what I was trying to convey.

Secondly, I made changes to the box plot, I hadn't processed my data before so my graph looked very complex with a lot of data. During the lec discussion they said that the plot was too complicated with data and suggested to reduce the data. So I resample the data using python and then re-updated the data, the new graph looks more concise and makes it simple to understand.




## The audience
The audience for my story has two categories: travelers who use Airbnb for their trips, and hosts who rent out Airbnb. They may not have a deep background in data science, so my focus is to use clear, concise charts and storytelling to help them understand the story behind the data and make judgments.

I gained some key insights from Lec's discussion and the part 2 interview, firstly I need to use simple, intuitive charts and graphs rather than show off complex technical analysis. Secondly, the audience is more interested in how the data translates directly into action, no one wants to go deeper to understand the complex logic behind the analysis. So I modified and adapted the charts so that I could present the results of the analysis in a more layman's terms.



# Final thoughts
Overall, I found this project to be a very rewarding experience that allowed me to explore data analysis and tell visualizations through storytelling. At first I just wanted to show the distribution of Airbnb's in Boston, and then during the process I realized that I could divide my audience into two categories and analyze the data from different perspectives. I hope that if I had more time, I could do more in-depth data exploration, such as using the Arima model to make predictions about the data and help mehost and travelers predict Airbnb prices in the future. I will continue to work on this project and talk about it as a project for my interview, this experience has allowed me to find a balance between technical complexity and comprehensibility for my audience.
